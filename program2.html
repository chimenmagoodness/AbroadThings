            Modern campuses set in lush countryside, multicultural student societies, top-class accommodation, buzzing city
            life…
            not to mention top-class education and career opportunities that are second to none. These are just some of the many
            reasons the UK is such a popular choice for students; in 2022/2023, nearly 800,000 international students chose to
            study
            here (House of Commons, 2024). So, if you’re looking for somewhere that offers innovative teaching, outstanding
            research, and fantastic industry links, then applying to a renowned institution such as the University of Surrey for
            your studies is a no-brainer. Here are the top 5 reasons to study in the UK.
        </p>
        
        <h1><strong>World-class education</strong></h1>
        <p>
            The top-quality teaching available at universities such as the University of Surrey is one of the main reasons that
            so
            many students choose to study here. The stats speak for themselves: shortlisted for University of the Year in 2023
            by
            the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide, the University of Surrey was also ranked 21th in the UK by the
            same
            guide in 2025. It regularly ranks globally in the top 100 for subjects including business and administration,
            computer
            science and electrical and electronic engineering (ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2023).
            Studying
            here means you’ll be learning from professors who are leaders in their field, within a beautiful, modern campus a
            short
            distance away from the nearest town of Guildford.
        </p>
        
        <h1><strong>Diverse course options</strong></h1>
        <p>
            The University of Surrey has a wide range of high-quality degrees on offer. The University is the UK’s top
            university
            for tourism, transport, travel and heritage studies (Complete University Guide 2025) and is in the world top 100 for
            nursing (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024). The University has excellent facilities for all subjects,
            however, its health science facilities are state-of-the-art. These include:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Critical care unit: a multi-functional space that can be used as an A&E, birthing suite, intensive care unit and
                an
                operating theatre.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Wards: designed to look and operate like typical wards you’d find in the NHS.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Community flat: transporting you to a patient’s home. This immersive environment allows you to tackle challenges
                in a
                non-clinical environment with limited equipment.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Ambulance Bay: comes with a fully functioning ambulance, equipped with everything you’d find in the NHS.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            One of the plus points of doing your International Foundation Year at Surrey is that you can then transition to any
            degree programme on offer at the University. On the International Foundation course, you can customise your modules
            according to the degree course you want to study. You’ll be able to improve your English and focus on the academic
            areas
            needed for your degree at the same time.
        
            
            <p ><br class="p-2"></p>
        
            There are also pre-courses available if you need extra help with your English before starting your pathway
            programme.
            These pre-courses are held online and are very effective at prepping students for their chosen pathway programme. In
            fact, 97% of students who completed their English Language Preparation Online programme between April and August
            2023
            progressed to their onward academic programme at their chosen International Study Centre.
        
            <p><br class="p-2"></p>
        
            If you’re nervous about starting your Foundation Year course at the University of Surrey, you’ll be able to access a
            three-week Enhanced Induction programme - at no extra cost to you - which will help you settle into life at
            university
            before your course begins.
        </p>

        <h1><strong>Cultural diversity and rich heritage</strong></h1>
        <p>
            The UK is a multicultural nation that celebrates diversity. With more than 140 nationalities represented at the
            University of Surrey, it’s one of the most culturally diverse universities in the UK. Leaving home can be scary but when
            you arrive at university, you’ll soon find a student club or society where you can meet people from a similar
            background. You will feel at home in no time. Living in Surrey means you’ll have the chance to immerse yourself in
            British life and traditions (fish and chips anyone?!) while also meeting people from all over the world.
        </p>

        <h1><strong>Strong support for international students</strong></h1>
        <p>
            Leaving home for the first time can be exciting but daunting at the same time, even more so if you’re moving abroad. If
            you choose somewhere like the University of Surrey, you’ll have access to several services that are there to support
            you, including the Health Centre and the Centre for Wellbeing. The Campus Safety team operates round the clock and you
            can contact them at any time of night or day, whether it’s an emergency or not. There’s even an airport pickup service
            for new international students arriving at Heathrow Airport.
        </p>

        <h1><strong>Career opportunities and employability</strong></h1>
        <p>
            There are many benefits of studying in the UK and knowing that you’re in the best place to start your career as a
            graduate is one of them. There are nearly a million job vacancies in the UK (Prospect, July 2024), with just over half
            of those being at graduate level, so it’s a good time to be studying here. The best route to getting one of these jobs
            is to study at a reputable university, gain work experience through placements and internships, and make the most of
            networking opportunities. Sometimes who you know can be as important as what you know, so it’s crucial to make the most
            of those university connections. The University of Surrey has been awarded the best university work placement service
            for four years in a row (most recently at the 2021 National University Employability Awards), making it one of the best
            places to become a highly employable graduate.
        </p>

        <h1><strong>Study at the University of Surrey</strong></h1>
        <p>
            As well as ranking highly in the major academic league tables, the University of Surrey was also ranked 11th in the UK
            for student satisfaction in the National Student Survey 2024. With hundreds of student clubs and societies available,
            joining one is the best way to explore your passions outside of your studies and make new friends. The International
            Study Centre is located on the University’s modern student campus, which has everything you need. There are also plenty
            of shops just a few streets away.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pt-1">
            There are three pathway programmes to choose from at the University of Surrey:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                International Foundation Year, which is a two-semester programme that prepares you to transition to the first year of an
                undergraduate degree through developing your academic and English language skills.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                International Year One, a two-semester programme that upon successful completion with the required grades allows you to
                transition straight to the second year of your undergraduate degree.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Pre-Masters Programme, an intensive one or two-semester programme that allows you to progress to a postgraduate degree.
            </li>
    
        </ul>

        <p class="pt-1">
            Before making your final decision, it’s important to find out more about visas, entry requirements and fees.
